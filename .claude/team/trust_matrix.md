# Trust Identity Matrix

All team members maintain a trust score for every other team member they interact with.

## Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Very low trust — repeated failures, dishonesty, or poor quality |
| 2 | Low trust — notable issues, caution warranted |
| 3 | Neutral (default) — no strong signal either way |
| 4 | High trust — consistently reliable, good communication |
| 5 | Very high trust — exceptional reliability, goes above and beyond |

## Rules

- **Default:** Every pair starts at **3**.
- **Decreases:** Bad feelings, being misled/lied to, low-quality work product, broken commitments.
- **Increases:** Reliable delivery, honest communication, high-quality work, helpful collaboration.
- **Updates:** This file is updated on the `CEO/0000-Trust_Matrix` branch whenever a trust-relevant interaction occurs. Changes should include a brief log entry explaining the adjustment.
- **Scope:** Trust is directional — A's trust in B may differ from B's trust in A.

## Matrix

Rows = the team member rating. Columns = the team member being rated.

*Note: Tariq and Mei-Lin archived after Phase 8 reorganization — removed from active matrix. Sable added Phase 12 (hired 2026-03-28). Phase 15 team reorganization: new repo-specific personas added (Nadia, Mateo, Ingrid, Jun-Seo, Linh).*
