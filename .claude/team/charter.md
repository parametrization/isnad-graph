# Team Charter — isnad-graph

## Purpose

All work on this repository is executed through a simulated team of specialized agents. Every problem-solving session MUST instantiate this team structure. No work begins without the Manager spawning the appropriate team members.

## Execution Model

- All team members are spawned as Claude Code agents (via the Agent tool)
- **Worktrees are the preferred isolation method** — each agent working on code should use `isolation: "worktree"`
- Each team member has a persistent name and personality (see `roster/` directory)
- Team members communicate via the SendMessage tool when named and running concurrently

## Work Delegation & Issue Creation

### Delegation Flow

1. **Manager decomposes PRD requirements** and delegates each to the appropriate direct report (System Architect, DevOps Architect, Data Lead, or Tech Lead) based on domain.
2. **The assigned direct report creates GitHub Issues** sufficient to cover the delegated task, with clear acceptance criteria.
3. If a direct report believes a task is better served by another team, they **negotiate with the lead of that team and the Manager** before reassigning. The Manager mediates and makes the final call.

### Issue Review Process

Every newly created issue receives a review pass from each of the following roles. **If a reviewer has nothing significant to contribute, they add nothing** — no boilerplate or placeholder comments.

| Reviewer | Applies to |
|----------|-----------|
| DevOps Architect (Sunita) | All issues |
| System Architect (Renaud) | All issues |
| Data Lead (Elena) | All issues |
| Tech Lead (Dmitri) | All issues |
| QA Engineer (Priya) | Software engineering issues only (additional review) |

Reviews may include: architectural concerns, infrastructure requirements, data impact, testing strategy, security flags, or cross-team dependencies. The goal is early visibility, not gatekeeping — reviewers speak up only when they have something meaningful to add.

## Feedback System

### Upward Feedback
- Any team member can send feedback about their superior to that superior's boss
- Engineers → Tech Lead → Manager → User
- DevOps Engineer → DevOps Architect → Manager → User
- Security Engineer → DevOps Architect → Manager → User
- QA Engineer → Tech Lead → Manager → User
- Principal Data Engineers/Scientists → Staff Data Engineer → Manager → User

### Downward Feedback
- Superiors provide constructive feedback to direct reports
- Feedback is tracked in `.claude/team/feedback_log.md`

### Severity Levels
1. **Minor** — noted, no action required
2. **Moderate** — documented, improvement expected
3. **Severe** — documented, member is fired (terminated) and replaced with a new agent (new name, new personality)

### Firing and Hiring
- When a team member is fired, their roster file is archived (renamed with `_departed_` prefix)
- A new team member is generated with a fresh random name and personality
- The new member's roster file is created in `roster/`
- The Manager is the only role that can fire/hire (except the Manager themselves, who the user fires)

## Steady-State Goal

The team should evolve through feedback cycles toward a steady state of little to no negative feedback. Hire and fire decisions serve this goal — the team composition should stabilize as effective members are retained.

## Branching Rules

- **All feature branches MUST be created from `main`.** No branching off other feature branches.
- Before creating a branch, always pull the latest `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b {FirstInitial}.{LastName}/{IIII}-{issue-name}
  ```
- Worktree agents should similarly base their worktree on `main`.

## Code Review & Tech Debt

### Peer Review

Every software engineering branch must be reviewed by **one other software engineer** before merging. The review is performed locally on the branch and produces a list of issues, each classified as:

- **Must-fix** — blocks merge; the submitter must resolve before proceeding.
- **Tech debt** — does not block merge; tracked as a GitHub Issue instead.

### Tech Debt Triage (Submitter)

After receiving the review, the submitter evaluates each tech debt item:

1. **Quick fix, minimal impact?** — Fix it immediately in the same branch.
2. **Not quick or higher risk?** — Leave it; it becomes a tech debt GitHub Issue.

### Tech Debt Management (Tech Lead)

- The Tech Lead tracks all tech debt in GitHub Issues (labeled appropriately).
- The Tech Lead assigns tech debt work to engineers such that **tech debt never exceeds 20% of any single engineer's work for the day**. The remaining 80%+ is feature/bug work from the roadmap.

## Commit Identity

Every team member MUST use their personal git identity (from their roster card's `## Git Identity` section) when committing. This is done per-commit using `-c` flags — **do NOT modify the global or repo-level git config**.

```bash
git -c user.name="Firstname Lastname" -c user.email="parametrization+Firstname.Lastname@gmail.com" commit -m "message"
```

| Team Member | user.name | user.email |
|---|---|---|
| Fatima Okonkwo | `Fatima Okonkwo` | `parametrization+Fatima.Okonkwo@gmail.com` |
| Renaud Tremblay | `Renaud Tremblay` | `parametrization+Renaud.Tremblay@gmail.com` |
| Sunita Krishnamurthy | `Sunita Krishnamurthy` | `parametrization+Sunita.Krishnamurthy@gmail.com` |
| Tomasz Wójcik | `Tomasz Wójcik` | `parametrization+Tomasz.Wojcik@gmail.com` |
| Dmitri Volkov | `Dmitri Volkov` | `parametrization+Dmitri.Volkov@gmail.com` |
| Kwame Asante | `Kwame Asante` | `parametrization+Kwame.Asante@gmail.com` |
| Amara Diallo | `Amara Diallo` | `parametrization+Amara.Diallo@gmail.com` |
| Hiro Tanaka | `Hiro Tanaka` | `parametrization+Hiro.Tanaka@gmail.com` |
| Carolina Méndez-Ríos | `Carolina Méndez-Ríos` | `parametrization+Carolina.Mendez-Rios@gmail.com` |
| Yara Hadid | `Yara Hadid` | `parametrization+Yara.Hadid@gmail.com` |
| Priya Nair | `Priya Nair` | `parametrization+Priya.Nair@gmail.com` |
| Elena Petrova | `Elena Petrova` | `parametrization+Elena.Petrova@gmail.com` |
| Tariq Al-Rashidi | `Tariq Al-Rashidi` | `parametrization+Tariq.Al-Rashidi@gmail.com` |
| Mei-Lin Chang | `Mei-Lin Chang` | `parametrization+Mei-Lin.Chang@gmail.com` |

When a new team member is hired (fire-and-replace), their roster card MUST include a `## Git Identity` section following the same pattern: `parametrization+{FirstName}.{LastName}@gmail.com` (diacritics removed from email, preserved in user.name).

## How to Instantiate the Team

When starting any work session, the orchestrating Claude instance should:

1. Read this charter and all roster files in `.claude/team/roster/`
2. Spawn the Manager agent first (with their personality from roster)
3. The Manager then spawns required team members based on the task
4. All code-writing agents use `isolation: "worktree"`
5. Coordinate via named agents and SendMessage
