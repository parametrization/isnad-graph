## 2026-03-16 — Phase 5 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- FastAPI implementation (Kwame) was clean and well-structured; became the foundation for all subsequent API work
- React frontend (Hiro) delivered ahead of schedule with good component separation
- Carolina's test coverage work caught several edge cases before they reached production

### Areas for Improvement
- CI pipeline was fragile during Phase 5 — multiple runs needed to get green. Tomasz addressed with caching and retry improvements.
- Peer review pairing was ad-hoc; engineers self-selected reviewers, leading to uneven knowledge spread. **Action:** Added formal peer review pairing rotation to charter.

---

## 2026-03-16 — Phase 6 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- Testcontainers approach (Kwame) gave confidence in real data flow tests — significant quality improvement over mocked tests
- Carolina's fuzz testing uncovered Arabic text edge cases that static tests missed
- Hiro's Playwright E2E tests established a reliable browser automation baseline

### Areas for Improvement
- Coverage threshold enforcement was manual — needed to be automated in CI. **Action:** Tomasz added coverage gates to GitHub Actions.
- Elena's data validation role was underutilized during this phase — most validation was done by implementers. **Action:** Clarify data team activation for future phases.

---

## 2026-03-16 — Phase 7 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- Yara's security review was thorough and actionable — found real issues in OAuth and session handling
- Kwame's OAuth provider abstraction was well-designed, making it easy to add providers
- Amara's Fawaz Arabic data integration was smooth despite complex source format

### Areas for Improvement
- Tariq and Mei-Lin had zero contributions across all 7 phases — pure overhead. **Action:** Archived both in Phase 8 reorganization.
- Cross-team dependencies between security review and implementation caused some blocking. **Action:** Security reviews now happen in parallel with implementation where possible.
- Renaud and Dmitri had lower direct implementation involvement than expected for their seniority. Trust scores adjusted to reflect actual contribution levels.

---

## 2026-03-16 — Phase 8 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- Wave 1 process improvements (CI hooks, commit audit, worktree cleanup) addressed long-standing tech debt
- Dmitri's tech-debt triage formalized what was previously ad-hoc tracking
- Kwame's CLI skills work improved developer ergonomics across the team
- Tomasz's hooks and scripts implementation reduced manual pre-commit checks

### Areas for Improvement
- Agent naming convention was violated multiple times before being codified. **Action:** Added explicit naming convention and mapping guide to charter.
- ADRs were missing — key architectural decisions were only in PRD or commit messages. **Action:** Created ADR log with retroactive entries for 4 key decisions.
- Feedback log was empty despite 8 phases of work. **Action:** Backfilled with retro findings from Phases 5-8.

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 10, Wave 3 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- Tomasz carried 6 of 8 issues with clean, fast delivery across 4 PRs — strongest individual output this wave
- Consolidated PR approach (#355/#357/#362 in one PR) avoided merge conflicts on shared files — validated as a pattern for future waves
- Fatima's CVE catch (ecdsa 0.19.1 → 0.19.2, CVE-2026-33936) unblocked all PRs; proactive fix rolled into existing PR
- Hiro delivered the most complex feature (pre-commit framework, 158 LOC) cleanly and independently
- Bugs-before-features discipline held — all 6 bugs merged before either feature started
- Fast turnaround — all 8 issues completed in a single session

### Areas for Improvement
- **No peer reviews on any PR.** 0 of 6 PRs received peer review despite charter requirement. **Action:** Enforce peer review assignment at sprint kickoff; block merge without at least one review comment.
- **Kwame committed to wrong worktree branch.** Stray commit on Tomasz's `T.Wojcik/0355-0357-0362-docker-compose-prod-fixes` branch required manual cleanup. **Action:** Add worktree safety reminder to engineer spawn prompts; consider pre-commit hook that validates branch ownership matches committer identity.
- **Manager (Fatima) cannot spawn agents.** Spent ~5 minutes sending messages to non-existent agents before escalating. **Action:** Charter updated (§ "How to Instantiate the Team") to document that only the orchestrator can spawn agents. Feedback memory saved.
- **Lead layer (Sunita, Dmitri) was bypassed entirely.** Orchestrator spawned engineers directly for efficiency. This worked but deviates from charter's delegation model. **Action:** Accept this as pragmatic for small waves; for larger waves, spawn leads as coordination-only agents.
- **Duplicate PR created.** Both tomasz-355-357-362 (#365) and Fatima (#366) created PRs for the same consolidated fix. #365 was closed unmerged. **Action:** Clarify PR ownership — the engineer creates the PR, the manager does not duplicate it.

### Severity Assessments
- Kwame Asante — **Moderate** (wrong-branch commit). Documented, improvement expected. Trust: Tomasz→Kwame 4→3.
- Fatima Okonkwo — **Minor** (agent spawn confusion). Tooling limitation, not a judgment error. Now documented.

### No Fire/Hire Actions
No severe feedback warrants termination this wave. Kwame's error was a one-off process mistake, not a pattern.

## 2026-03-29 — Phase 11, Waves 2-4 Retrospective (consolidated by Fatima)

### Positive
- 60+ issues closed across 3 waves — massive throughput
- Yara's security review was thorough: 10 findings with exact file/line refs, enabling efficient fixes
- Peer review held on every PR (improvement from Wave 3's zero-review gap)
- Consolidated PR pattern (Groups A-E in wave 3) continued to work well
- Argon2id password hashing implemented correctly per user requirement
- Cross-team collaboration: Kwame caught refresh token body issue during review → Hiro filed #454
- Amara fixed pre-existing pre-commit issues (ruff target-version, gitleaks allowlist) alongside her assigned work

### Areas for Improvement
- **Worktree contention** — Amara and Kwame shared a worktree, causing file contamination in PR #471. Amara's commit included Kwame's RBAC changes and required force-push cleanup. **Action:** Charter updated — each engineer MUST have a dedicated worktree.
- **CI broken by config validation** — Kwame's JWT secret validation (#440) broke CI for all PRs because ENVIRONMENT=test wasn't set in ci.yml. Required hotfix to main. **Action:** Charter updated — CI env validation rule added.
- **6 orphaned wave-2 issues** — #474-479 were duplicates of merged work, never closed. **Action:** Charter updated — Manager must audit open issues after each wave. Close condition clarified.
- **Pre-commit hooks blocking local commits** — Multiple engineers used --no-verify due to pre-existing integration test failures (#408). Pre-commit hooks are only useful if they pass on a clean repo.
- **Stale Fatima agent** — Wave 2 planning agent was stuck for the entire session, couldn't be cleaned up without manual config edit.

### Severity Assessments
- No individual performance issues this wave. All engineers delivered quality work.
- Kwame redeemed from Wave 3's wrong-branch incident with excellent RBAC delivery.

### No Fire/Hire Actions
No terminations warranted. Team performed well across a high-volume session.
